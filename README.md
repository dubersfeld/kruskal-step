# kruskal-step
Java based demonstration of Minimum Spanning Tree Kruskal algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX.

I present here a Java based demonstration of the Kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm. 

The algorithm itself is implemented in Java, Javascript is only used for initiaization and display on Canvas.

First an undirected graph is randomly created and its largest connected component is extracted (Java side).

Then a minimum spanning tree is build stepwise (Java side) and the graph is redrawn on each step (browser side).

When deployed on Tomcat the context root is minimum-spanning-tree.
